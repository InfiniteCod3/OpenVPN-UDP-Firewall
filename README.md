This is a broken down and simpler version of my current OpenVPN UDP Setup.  This setup includes a Hashlimit of 1 PPS to all NEW UDP traffic, Accepting ICMP traffic at a rate of 1 PPS to allow an icmp ping to be made, Accepting a Control Hard Reset Packet at 1 PPS, and Dropping Invalid Packets.  My more in depth firewall I use personally on my setup includes the proccess of matching traffic with bpfs on multiple packets including Control Hard Reset, AckV1, Continuation and PdataV2.  Message me on Telegram @NateSys if you have any questions at all, or are interested in purchasing a more complex firewall, thx.  Credit to Anthony for Idea of Doing a Script.
